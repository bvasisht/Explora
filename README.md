Explora consolidates all events occurring near a University at a given time and presents it to the user. 
It helps students by providing them with a chance to engage more with community and helps clubs by providing them 
with a platform to advertise their events.
My team consisting of a design major and 4 computer science majors created a working website and also a mockup of an iOS app
during Creatathon at Davis.
My contribution was front-end developent and some back-end database related work.
